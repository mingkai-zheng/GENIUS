Which stage should use a more complex operation, and which stage should use a simpler operation?\n4. Which stage should have more layers (deeper)? and which should have fewer layers (shallower)? (Note that you can use the Skip layer to control the depth of each stage)\n\nNow, using your analysis and design principles, please provide a list of 30 operation IDs for the undefined layers (5 stages) that will maximize the performance of the model on ImageNet. Please explain how the chosen model design will achieve this.\nAdditionally, please ensure that the total FLOPS of the model (including both defined and undefined layers) remains in [270, 330]"

Which stage should use a more complex operation, and which stage should use a simpler operation?\nThe early stages (Stage 1 and 2) should use simpler operations, while the later stages (Stage 3, 4, and 5) should use more complex operations.\n\n4. Which stage should have more layers (deeper)? and which should have fewer layers (shallower)?\nThe later stages should be deeper to capture more complex features, while the early stages can be shallower.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can design a model with the following operation IDs for the undefined layers:\n\nStage 1 (Layer 2 to Layer 7): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nStage 2 (Layer 8 to Layer 13): [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nStage 3 (Layer 14 to Layer 19): [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\nStage 4 (Layer 20 to Layer 25): [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\nStage 5 (Layer 26 to Layer 31): [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n\nThis design uses simpler operations in the early stages and more complex operations in the later stages. It also makes the later stages deeper by adding more layers. The Skip operation is used to control the depth of each stage and reduce the computational cost.\n\nThe total FLOPS of this model can be calculated by summing the FLOPS of each operation in each layer, including both defined and undefined layers.

Utilizing varying operations within each stage to allow better customization and avoiding overfitting.\n\nI believe this configuration could outperform previous designs because:\n\n- In Stage 1 and 2, I added more InvertedResidual layers with kernel_size=3 and expansion=4 to capture more information in the early stages while keeping the complexity (FLOPS) low.\n- In Stage 3, I used a mix of InvertedResidual operations with kernel_size=5 and expansion=4 and kernel_size=7 and expansion=4 to improve the capacity of capturing complex features at this level with medium complexity.\n- In Stage 4, I slightly increased the complexity of operations by combining mixed kernel sizes (3 and 5) with expansion=6, which can capture more complex features without significantly increasing FLOPS.\n- In Stage 5, I made this stage deeper and more powerful by employing InvertedResidual operations with kernel_size=5 and expansion=6 and kernel_size=7 and expansion=6 to capture the most complex features in the final stages of the network.\n\nThe total FLOPS for this configuration should be within the range of [270, 330]. By following the design principles and leveraging lessons learned from previous experiments, I expect this model to achieve even better performance on ImageNet than the previous designs we considered."

In Stage 1 and 2, we use simpler operations: lots of InvertedResidual layers with kernel_size=3 and expansion=4, intermixed with Skip layers. This ensures the model can capture low-level information with lower FLOPS cost.\n2. Stage 3 starts with a more complex operation (4, which has expansion=6), followed by simpler operations (2, with kernel_size=5 and expansion=4). This allows the model to start to capture more complex information but remains less computationally expensive.\n3. Stage 4 introduces kernel_size=5 and expansion=6, which are more powerful and complex operations. It possesses several layers with operation 4 and interleaves operation 5 to maintain strong feature extraction capability.\n4. Stage 5 represents the deepest stage by using more complex operations: a combination of kernel_size=7, expansion=6 (operation 6), and kernel_size=5, expansion=6 (operation 5). The alteration of the powerful operations ensures the model captures highly complex features and maintains a high-performance score.\n\nThis design will achieve high performance on ImageNet as it follows the design principles: utilizing simpler operations in earlier stages and gradually introducing more complex operations through later stages. It also varies the combinations and patterns previously tested, improving the model's ability to efficiently capture low to high-level features. Moreover, the depth control using Skip layers helps in the overall complexity management.\n\nThe proposed design has an estimated FLOPS of around 325, which falls within the [270, 330] constraint. I believe this design will outperform previous designs as it better adheres to the design principles and utilizes learning from the earlier experiments. It takes into account proper balance in the complexity and follows a gradual progression towards more complicated operations in later stages."

The early stages (Stage 1 and 2) should use simpler operations, while the later stages (Stage 3, 4, and 5) should use more complex operations.\n4. The later stages should be deeper to capture more complex features, while the early stages can be shallower.

This helps the model capture more complex features and adapt well to the ImageNet dataset.\n\n2.

We gradually increase the depth and complexity of operations for each subsequent stage, leading to a better balance between model capacity and generalization ability.\n\n4.

Here is a detailed explanation of the proposed model design:\n\n1. Stage 1 focuses on simpler operations, with two InvertedResidual operations (kernel_size=3, expansion=4) used for Layers 2 and 4. This allows the model to capture low-level features more efficiently.\n \n2. Stage 2 continues to focus on less complex operations, with three InvertedResidual operations (kernel_size=3, expansion=4) used for Layers 8, 9, and 10. This setup ensures the early stages remain simple and efficient.\n \n3. Stage 3 gradually increases the complexity by introducing InvertedResidual operations (kernel_size=3, expansion=6) in Layers 14 and 16, combined with an InvertedResidual operation (kernel_size=5, expansion=4) in Layer 17, to capture higher-level information.\n \n4. Stage 4 further increases the complexity, with two InvertedResidual (kernel_size=3, expansion=6) operations in Layers 20, 22, and two additional InvertedResidual operations (kernel_size=5, expansion=4) operations in Layers 24 and 25. This change allows the model to focus on capturing more complex features and details.\n \n5. Stage 5 includes three InvertedResidual (kernel_size=5, expansion=6) operations in Layers 26, 28, and 29 for better higher-level feature extraction.\n\nIn comparison to previous designs, the proposed model takes a more balanced approach with a combination of optimal operations for each stage\u2014simplicity for early stages, and increased complexity for later stages. This design maximizes the model's performance while ensuring that the total FLOPS constraints are met. Furthermore, this design improves the effectiveness of the stages in capturing low-level and high-level features by selecting appropriate InvertedResidual operations and maximizing the network's overall performance for the ImageNet dataset."

I adjusted the operations based on previous experiments to make sure we have a mix of powerful operations (with larger kernel sizes and expansion factors) and simpler operations in those early stages. This should enable the model to better capture various low-level features without increasing the FLOPS significantly.\n\nFor the later stages (Stage 3, 4 & 5), I use more complex operations. In Stage 3, I added 4s and 2s, while in Stage 4, I replaced a skip (0) operation with more 4s and added another 2 operation. This should allow the model to capture more complex features. For Stage 5, I introduced 6 as a new operation and distributed the 5 operations more evenly. As the last stage, Stage 5 should be able to use the powerful operations more effectively to capture high-level features, resulting in a more expressive model.\n\nBy utilizing complex operations in the right layers and stages while keeping the FLOPS within the desired range, this model design should achieve better performance compared to previous designs. It strikes a more balanced approach in terms of powerful operations across stages while leveraging better connections across respective stages."

This design follows the design principles by using simpler layers in the early stages (1 and 2) and more complex layers in the later stages (3, 4, and 5). This helps in capturing low-level information early on and high-level information later in the model layers.\n\n2. We use larger kernel sizes (5 and 7) and higher expansion factors (6) in the later stages, capturing more complex features, and having higher FLOPS. In the early stages, we utilize smaller kernel sizes (3) and lower expansion factors.\n\n3. The stage depths are controlled, with early stages being shallower and the later stages being deeper for capturing more complex features.\n\n4. The proposed design adapts and refines characteristics from previous designs, such as Experiment 4 which has similar number of FLOPS (329), but this design adds more complexity to Stage 2 with an additional layer before skipping two layers, which is expected to improve the performance.\n\n5. In comparison to previous experiments, this design strikes a balance by maintaining lower FLOPS and increasing the representation power through strategic layering, allowing the model to outperform them.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed design is expected to achieve better performance on the ImageNet dataset while maintaining the FLOPS constraint. Given the balance in complexity and adherence to design principles, this design is expected to outperform previous designs."
