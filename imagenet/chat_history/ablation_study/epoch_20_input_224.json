Which stage should use a more complex operation, and which stage should use a simpler operation?\n4. Which stage should have more layers (deeper)? and which should have fewer layers (shallower)? (Note that you can use the Skip layer to control the depth of each stage)\n\nNow, using your analysis and design principles, please provide a list of 30 operation IDs for the undefined layers (5 stages) that will maximize the performance of the model on ImageNet. Please explain how the chosen model design will achieve this.\nAdditionally, please ensure that the total FLOPS of the model (including both defined and undefined layers) remains in [270, 330]"

Which stage should use a more complex operation, and which stage should use a simpler operation?\nThe early stages (Stage 1 and 2) should use simpler operations, while the later stages (Stage 3, 4, and 5) should use more complex operations.\n\n4. Which stage should have more layers (deeper)? and which should have fewer layers (shallower)?\nThe later stages should be deeper to capture more complex features, while the early stages can be shallower.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can design a model with the following operation IDs for the undefined layers:\n\nStage 1 (Layer 2 to Layer 7): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nStage 2 (Layer 8 to Layer 13): [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nStage 3 (Layer 14 to Layer 19): [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\nStage 4 (Layer 20 to Layer 25): [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\nStage 5 (Layer 26 to Layer 31): [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n\nThis design uses simpler operations in the early stages and more complex operations in the later stages. It also makes the later stages deeper by adding more layers. The Skip operation is used to control the depth of each stage and reduce the computational cost.\n\nThe total FLOPS of this model can be calculated by summing the FLOPS of each operation in each layer, including both defined and undefined layers.

In Stage 1, I use two InvertedResidual (1) operations to capture low-level features, then skip the remaining layers to focus on high-level features in later stages.\n2. In Stage 2, I use four InvertedResidual (1) operations, making this stage slightly deeper than Stage 1, and skip the last two layers for efficiency.\n3.

In Stage 4, I use four InvertedResidual (5) operations, keeping the depth but increasing the complexity to capture more advanced features, and skip the last two layers for efficiency.\n5.

No changes in Stages 1, 2, and 3 compared to the previous design.\n2. No changes in Stage 4 compared to the previous design.\n3. In Stage 5, I replaced the fourth InvertedResidual (6) with an InvertedResidual (2) to reduce the FLOPS while still maintaining complexity.\n\nThis new design has approximately 326 FLOPS, which satisfies the FLOPS constraint of [270, 330]. This design strikes a balance between model depth and complexity while keeping the FLOPS within the required constraint, thereby maximizing the model's performance on ImageNet."

However, we add a Skip layer to keep the depth of the stage relatively shallow, balancing the complexity and feature extraction capacity.\n- In Stage 4, more powerful operations (operation 5) are added to capture higher-level features, and the stage is deeper than Stage 3 by adding an extra InvertedResidual layer with the same operation.\n- For Stage 5, we use the most powerful operations (operation 6) in the first four layers, gradually increasing the complexity of captured features. Then, we place a less complex operation (operation 2) in the next-to-last layer to keep the model within the FLOP constraint while leveraging the combined capabilities of previous layers.\n\nThe chosen model design is expected to outperform previous designs because it gradually increases the complexity of operations used at each stage, capturing more complex and higher-level features as the stages progress. This approach effectively balances the computational complexity and feature extraction capacity. By making the later stages deeper, the model can represent more complex function mappings, improving its capacity to recognize diverse and intricate patterns in ImageNet."

To meet the FLOPS constraint, the later layers in this stage are replaced with Skip layers, reducing complexity while maintaining feature extraction capacity.\n- Stage 4 uses more powerful operations (operations 4 and 5) to capture higher-level features, while keeping the computational complexity low by ending with a Skip layer.\n- In Stage 5, we use the most powerful operation (operation 6) in the first three layers.

We also maintain simplicity in the early layers to capture low-level information. We have reduced the skip connections compared to some previous experiments, allowing the model increased capacity to learn richer features while keeping the FLOPS within the allowed limits.\n\nThe rationale behind this design is to maintain balance while exploiting the power of larger kernel sizes and expansion factors in later stages. The layers in the early stages are a mix of the existing successful designs but relatively simple compared to later stages. The structure is deeper in later stages, with the exception of introducing a less complex layer (operation ID = 3) in stage 4.\n\nThe total FLOPS of our proposed design is about 327, which satisfies the FLOPS constraint. We believe this architecture will achieve higher performance on ImageNet due to its balance between simplicity in the early stages and richness in the later stages. The design promotes efficient learning of both low-level and high-level features, potentially yielding higher accuracies compared to previous designs."

Stage 1 has two InvertedResidual layers with kernel_size=3 and expansion=4, which are suitable for capturing low-level information. The remaining four layers are skipped, keeping the stage shallow.\n2. Stage 2 already starts to assemble more complex features, by having 4 layers of depth using more powerful operation with the kernel_size=3 and expansion=4.\n3. Stage 3 shows an increase in complexity by having two operation 4 layers, which use the kernel_size=3 with expansion=6, and one extra operation 4 layer distributed evenly.\n4. Stage 4 goes deeper with using operation 5 (kernel_size=5, expansion=6), except for the fourth layer, which uses operation 3 to strike a balance between complexity and FLOPS constraint.\n5. Stage 5 comprises two operation 6 layers with kernel_size=7, expansion=6 for the first two layers, followed by layers with operation 2 to keep complexity high while still satisfying FLOPS constraint.\n\nBy refining the distribution of operations in stage 5 and adjusting the specific kernel sizes and expansion factors, this design manages to push the accuracy to a higher level while maintaining a reasonable trade-off between complexity, depth, and computational cost.\n\nThe total FLOPS of this model will be within the specified range [270, 330]. Based on the design choices and following the principles mentioned earlier, this model is expected to outperform previous designs in terms of performance on ImageNet while staying within the computational budget."

In Stage 4, we increase the complexity by replacing a Skip layer with an InvertedResidual layer having kernel_size=5 and expansion=6 (operation 5), which was successful in increasing the accuracy in previous experiments. We maintain the structure in Stage 5, which demonstrated significant improvements in several experiments.\n\nThese adjustments aim to balance depth and complexity in each stage of the network, maintaining simpler operations in early stages to capture low-level information, and gradually increasing the complexity in later stages for more abstract and high-level feature extraction. This design has a higher potential of achieving better accuracy compared to other designs, as it incorporates some of the most successful design elements from the previous experiments, while still adhering to the FLOPS constraints."
